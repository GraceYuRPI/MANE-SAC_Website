        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>

        The MANE Student Advisory Council was formed in October 2006 in an effort to formalize student representation within departmental activities. Today, the council is responsible for many activities in our department, including organizing the Student Advisory Council Graduate Seminars, working with curriculum development and ABET accreditation, participating in faculty hiring, and aiding in department outreach and student recruitment.
        <br>
        Through interactions with faculty, staff, administration, and most importantly students, the MANE Student Advisory Council strives to improve the educational services offered by RPI.  Through the innovative approach of the council and uniquely close relationship the council has with the echelons of the RPI community, it has been able to affect the way students learn, the methods by which professors teach, and establish a strong foundation of student support for the Mechanical, Aerospace, and Nuclear Engineering Department.
